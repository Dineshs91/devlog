      <p>A log book.</p>

      Have something on your mind, note it down in devlog. An idea striked you, jot it down here. It supports tags making it 
      convenient to manage your logs.<br/><br/>
      
      It is a cross platform, desktop application designed to assist you in keeping track of your notes, ideas etc in a simple yet
      intuitive way.
      
      <h3>Key Features</h3>
      <h4>Ease of use</h4>
      Open, add and write that's it. Devlog with its auto save functionality, just requires you to write down stuff and saves you the trouble,
      of having to save everytime you write something.<br/><br/>
      Don't believe me, <a href="downloads.html">see it</a> for yourself.<br/><br/>
      
      <img src="Demo.gif"></img>
      
      Manual save is also available, for those who are uncomfortable with autosave. Press (cmd or ctrl) + s or click on save and be in 
      peace.
      
      <h4>Tagging</h4>
      <p>
      Tags allow you to organize your logs. It allows you to group similar log entries together.<br/><br/>
      <img src="tagging.png"></img><br/><br/>
      It also supports multiple tags, so you can add multiple tags to a log. By default, there is a tag named "all" which defaults to all the logs
      that would be created. Create multiple tags be typing multiple tags seperated by comma.
      </p>

      <h4>Recover deleted logs</h4>
      <p>We are human beings and we tend to make mistakes a lot. Don't worry if you have removed a log by accident. Stay calm. Press 
      (cmd or ctrl) + r or choose restore/delete from options menu.<br/>
      Voila! all your deleted logs are safe. Choose what you want to do.<br/><br/>
      There are 2 options, delete and restore. Delete, removes the log permanently from the application and the log deleted cannot be recovered 
      after this action. The second option, restore, choose it if you wish to restore the log back into the app.<br/><br/>
      <img src="restore-delete.png"></img><br/><br/>
      
      After chosing an action, press save changes. There you go, your logs are restored/deleted depending on your choice.<br/>
      Click cancel if you don't want to take any action.<br/><br/>
      
      <strong>Note:</strong> The list of deleted logs can grow to be a huge mess. Make sure, you permanently remove any logs that you don't
      need anymore.
